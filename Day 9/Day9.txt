#1. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list.

list = [1,2,3,4,5]
listsum = sum(list)
print("Sum of the elements in the list is",listsum)



#2. Write a Python program to get the largest and smallest number from a list without builtin functions.

a = [345,234,5,2345,4,534,234]
smallest = a[0]
largest = a[0]

for val in a:
	if val < smallest:
		smallest = val
	if val > largest:
		largest = val

print("The Smallest Element is",smallest)
print("The Largest Element is",largest)



#3. Write a Python program to find duplicate values from a list and display those.

a = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 5]
s = set()
dup = []

for n in a:
    if n in s:
        dup.append(n)
    else:
        s.add(n)

print("The Duplicate Elements are",dup)



# 4. Write a Python program to split a given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is given.
# Original list: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1]
# Length of the first part of the list: 3
# Splitted the said list into two parts: ([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])

def split_two_parts(n_list, L):
	return n_list[:L], n_list[L:]

n_list = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1]

print("Original list:")
print(n_list)

first_list_length = 3

print("\nLength of the first part of the list:", first_list_length)
print("\nSplit the said list into two parts:")
print(split_two_parts(n_list, first_list_length))



# 5. Write a Python program to traverse a given list in reverse order, and print the elements with the original index.
# Original list: ['red', 'green', 'white', 'black']
# Traverse the said list in reverse order:
# black
# white
# green
# red

color = ["red", "green", "white", "black"]

print("Original list:")
print(color)

print("\nTraverse the said list in reverse order:")

for i in reversed(color):
	print(i)

print("\nTraverse the said list in reverse order with original index:")

for i, el in reversed(list(enumerate(color))):
	print(i, el)
